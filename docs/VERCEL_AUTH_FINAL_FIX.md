# Final Vercel Authentication Fix

## What was the actual problem?

The issue wasn't with the auth configuration itself, but with the middleware interfering with the OAuth callback flow. After successful Google authentication, the middleware was immediately checking for authentication before the session was fully established, causing a redirect loop.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated middleware.ts**:
   - Added logic to skip middleware for OAuth callback routes
   - Added special handling for the signin page with callbackUrl - if user is already authenticated, redirect them to their intended destination
   - This prevents the redirect loop after successful authentication

2. **Reverted auth.ts**:
   - Removed the redirect callback (wasn't needed)
   - Removed cookie configuration (was causing issues)
   - Kept it simple and clean

3. **Reverted SignInForm.tsx**:
   - Back to original `redirectTo` syntax

## Why this works

The key insight is that the middleware needs to:

1. Allow the OAuth callback to complete without interference
2. Check if a user visiting `/auth/signin?callbackUrl=/feed` is already authenticated and redirect them
3. This handles the case where the OAuth callback redirects back to signin with the callbackUrl

## Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: handle OAuth callback in middleware to prevent redirect loop"
git push
```

## Test Steps

1. Clear browser cookies for your domain
2. Visit https://www.pokerconnect.me/feed
3. You'll be redirected to signin
4. Click "Continue with Google"
5. After selecting your account, you should be redirected to /feed

## Important Notes

- Your NEXTAUTH_URL is correctly set to `https://www.pokerconnect.me`
- Your Google OAuth redirect URIs should include `https://www.pokerconnect.me/api/auth/callback/google`
- The debug endpoint at `/api/auth/debug` can help verify session state

## If it still doesn't work on Vercel

1. Add `NEXTAUTH_DEBUG=true` to Vercel environment variables temporarily
2. Check Vercel function logs for any errors
3. Use the debug endpoint to verify session creation
4. Make sure cookies are being set for the correct domain

The fix is minimal and focused on the actual problem - the middleware was interfering with the OAuth flow.
