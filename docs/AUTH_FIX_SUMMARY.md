# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Timeline & Resolution

### Initial Problem

Users were stuck in a redirect loop on the signin page after successful Google OAuth authentication.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing redirectTo parameter** (Primary Issue)
   - The `signIn('google')` call wasn't specifying where to redirect after authentication
   - Fixed by adding: `await signIn('google', { redirectTo: callbackUrl });`

2. **Port Configuration Mismatch**
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001` (incorrect)
   - Fixed by aligning all URLs to port 3000

3. **Component Export/Import Mismatch**
   - During optimization, sidebar components were renamed with "Next" suffix
   - `SidebarNavigation` → `SidebarNavigationNext`
   - `SidebarStatsOverview` → `SidebarStatsOverviewNext`
   - GlobalSidebar was still importing old names
   - Fixed by renaming exports back to original names

## Key Files Modified

### Authentication Flow

- `/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Added redirectTo parameter to signIn call
- `/middleware.ts` - Already had proper error handling and callbackUrl
- `/src/lib/auth.ts` - Added environment validation and proper callbacks
- `/.env.local` - Fixed port configuration (3001 → 3000)

### Component Fixes

- `/src/components/sidebar/SidebarNavigation.tsx` - Renamed export from SidebarNavigationNext to SidebarNavigation
- `/src/components/sidebar/SidebarStatsOverview.tsx` - Renamed export from SidebarStatsOverviewNext to SidebarStatsOverview

## Lessons Learned

1. Always ensure OAuth redirects have explicit destinations
2. Maintain consistent port configuration across all environment variables
3. When merging branches, verify component names match their imports
4. The "Next" suffix components were remnants from migration that should have been cleaned up

## Testing Checklist

- [x] User can sign in with Google
- [x] User is redirected to /feed after authentication
- [x] Protected routes properly redirect unauthenticated users
- [x] Feed page loads without 500 errors
- [x] Sidebar components render correctly
