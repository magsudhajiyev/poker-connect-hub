# UI Highlighting Synchronization Fix

**Date**: January 9, 2025
**Issue**: UI continued highlighting wrong player after action completed

## The Problem

After UTG checked on the flop, the poker engine correctly advanced to CO, but the UI continued to highlight/flash UTG instead of CO. This made it impossible to click on CO to continue the hand.

## Root Cause Analysis

The PokerTable component's `isPlayerToAct` function was not reactive to engine state changes. While it was checking the correct value, the component wasn't re-rendering when `engineState.betting.actionOn` changed.

## The Solution

### 1. Added Direct Subscription to Engine State

**File**: `/app/share-hand/components/poker-table/PokerTable.tsx`

```typescript
// Before: No direct subscription to actionOn
const storeIsPlayerToAct = usePokerHandStore((state) => state.isPlayerToAct);

// After: Direct subscription forces re-render
const actionOn = usePokerHandStore((state) => state.engineState?.currentState?.betting?.actionOn);
```

### 2. Simplified Player Highlighting Logic

**File**: `/app/share-hand/components/poker-table/PokerTable.tsx`

```typescript
// Before: Using store method (less reactive)
const isPlayerToAct = (position: string) => {
  const player = getPlayerAtPosition(position);
  return storeIsPlayerToAct(player.id);
};

// After: Direct comparison (immediate reactivity)
const isPlayerToAct = (position: string) => {
  const player = getPlayerAtPosition(position);
  return player.id === actionOn;
};
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging

Added console logging to track when the current player changes for easier debugging.

## Testing Sequence

1. UTG raises preflop → BTN calls → Street advances to flop
2. UTG checks on flop → Engine advances to BTN
3. UI immediately updates highlighting from UTG to BTN ✅
4. BTN can now be clicked to show action dialog ✅
5. Clicking UTG shows error (correct behavior) ✅

## Key Learnings

1. **Reactivity is crucial**: Components must subscribe to the specific state they depend on
2. **Direct state access**: Sometimes simpler is better - direct comparison against engine state is more reliable than indirect methods
3. **Single source of truth**: The engine's `betting.actionOn` is the authoritative source for who should act
