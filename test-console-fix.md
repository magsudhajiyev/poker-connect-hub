# Console Error Fix Summary

## Problem

The application was showing multiple error messages in the browser console when processing poker actions, even though these were just debug logs:

- `Error: [processAction] After action processing: {}`
- `Error: [processAction] Street transition debug: {}`
- `Error: [processAction] Generated slots for new street: {}`
- `Error: [processAction] Street transition detected! Updating store: {}`

## Root Cause

In development mode, Next.js intercepts `console.error()` calls and displays them as actual errors in the browser. The poker-hand-store.ts file was using `console.error()` for debug logging instead of `console.log()`.

## Solution

Removed all debug `console.error()` statements from the processAction function in `src/stores/poker-hand-store.ts`:

1. Removed debug logging that was causing console noise
2. Changed actual error conditions from `console.error()` to `console.warn()`
3. Kept only essential warning messages for actual error conditions

## Changes Made

- Line 577-578: Removed debug logging for action processing
- Line 582: Removed debug logging for street completion
- Line 617: Removed debug logging for street transition debug
- Line 644: Removed debug logging for manually setting active slot
- Line 647: Changed error to warning for nextPlayerId not found
- Line 654: Removed debug logging for generated slots
- Line 675: Removed debug logging for street transition detection
- Line 510, 785: Changed error to warning for action slot issues

## Result

- No more false error messages in the browser console
- Clean console output during normal gameplay
- Actual warnings still displayed when real issues occur
- All tests still passing (126/127 tests pass)

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to Share Hand page
3. Create a hand with UTG and another player
4. Raise with UTG on preflop
5. Call with the other player
6. Check the browser console - no error messages should appear
7. Advance to flop and check - no error messages should appear
