### Stack Update Flow Tests (5/5 passing)
1. ✓ Displays initial stack sizes correctly after blinds
2. ✓ Updates stack sizes after a raise action
3. ✓ Updates stack sizes after an all-in action
4. ✓ Preserves stack sizes when advancing streets
5. ✓ Handles multiple actions in sequence correctly

## What These Tests Verify

### Component-Level Testing (PlayerSeatDisplayOptimized)
- The component correctly displays stack sizes
- Stack changes trigger re-renders
- All-in status is properly displayed
- Bet amounts are shown correctly
- The memoization logic properly detects when updates are needed

### Integration Testing (Stack Update Flow)
- Initial blinds correctly reduce player stacks
- Raise actions update the raiser's stack
- All-in actions set stack to 0
- Stack sizes persist when moving between streets
- Multiple sequential actions update stacks correctly

## Key Fixes Implemented

1. **usePlayerActionDialog Hook**: Now reads current stack from engine state
   ```typescript
   const getCurrentStackSize = () => {
     if (store.engineState?.currentState?.players) {
       const enginePlayer = playersMap.get(player.id);
       if (enginePlayer && typeof enginePlayer.stackSize === 'number') {
         return enginePlayer.stackSize;
       }
     }
     return Array.isArray(player.stackSize) ? player.stackSize[0] : player.stackSize || 0;
   };
   ```

2. **Removed Quick Bet Buttons**: Per user request, removed non-functional betting shortcuts

3. **Store Deep Cloning**: Already implemented, ensures React detects changes

## Ready for User Testing

All tests are passing. The stack update functionality should now work correctly in the UI:
- Blinds will reduce stacks
- Raises will update stacks immediately
- All-ins will show stack as 0 or "All-in"
- Stack changes persist across streets
