# Development Diary - July 6, 2025

## üéØ Today's Achievements

### Morning Session

- **Fixed JWT Authentication Error in Production**
  - Added fallback to NextAuth session when JWT_SECRET is not configured
  - Resolved production crashes on Vercel deployment
  - Implemented graceful error handling for authentication

### Comment & Like Feature Implementation

- **Created feat/comment-like Branch**
  - Implemented full comment add/delete functionality
  - Fixed like toggle with proper optimistic UI updates
  - Added real-time comment counts and like counts
  - Resolved TypeScript errors with Mongoose lean() queries

### Key Bug Fixes

- **Like Count Display Issue**
  - Fixed "like count still shows 0" bug
  - Added computed fields for likeCount and commentCount from arrays
  - Ensured proper type casting for all lean() query results

### User Profiles Feature

- **Created feat/user-profiles Branch**
  - Added clickable user functionality across all components
  - Enhanced UserAvatar component with automatic hover effects
  - Implemented visual feedback with cursor pointer and scale effects
  - Added emerald ring highlight on hover for better UX

### Major Refactoring

- **Fixed Duplicate Profile Page Issue**
  - Discovered existing profile system at `/profile`
  - Removed duplicate profile page at `/profile/[id]`
  - Added temporary toast notifications for user clicks
  - Prepared foundation for future user profile viewing

## üîß Technical Details

### API Routes Created

- `/api/hands/[id]/comments` - POST endpoint for adding comments
- `/api/hands/[id]/comments/[commentId]` - DELETE endpoint for removing comments
- `/api/users/[id]` - GET endpoint for fetching user profiles (ready for future use)

### Components Updated

- `UserAvatar` - Now accepts onClick prop with automatic visual feedback
- `FeedPostCard` - Integrated clickable users with proper event handling
- `HandViewCard` - Migrated from Avatar to UserAvatar component
- `HandViewComments` - Added clickable functionality to comment authors

### Deployment Process

- Followed established workflow: feature branch ‚Üí merge to main ‚Üí push
- Fixed all ESLint errors before commits
- Successfully deployed two major features to production

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check Existing Code** - Nearly created duplicate functionality when profile system already existed
2. **Type Safety with Mongoose** - lean() queries require explicit type casting for TypeScript
3. **Visual Feedback Matters** - Small hover effects make huge difference in UX
4. **Component Consistency** - Using shared components (UserAvatar) ensures uniform behavior

## üöÄ What's Next

1. **Implement Full User Profile Viewing** - Build on the existing profile system to show other users' profiles
2. **Add User Following System** - Allow users to follow each other
3. **Notification System** - Notify users of new comments/likes on their hands
4. **Enhanced Social Features** - Private messages, user search, etc.

## üí≠ Final Thoughts

Today was highly productive\! We successfully implemented two major features (comments/likes and clickable users) while maintaining code quality and fixing critical bugs. The codebase is becoming more social and interactive. The temporary toast notifications for user profiles set clear expectations while we build the full feature.

Key insight: Sometimes the best solution is to work with existing systems rather than creating new ones. The existing profile infrastructure is solid - we just need to extend it for viewing other users.
