## Project: Poker Connect Hub - Authentication Integration Fix

### Challenge Faced

The application had a critical authentication issue where users signing in with Google OAuth couldn't complete the onboarding process. They were getting 401 Unauthorized errors because:

- Two separate authentication systems (NextAuth for Google OAuth, Backend JWT for API calls)
- Google OAuth users got NextAuth sessions but no backend JWT cookies
- Onboarding endpoint required JWT authentication that Google users didn't have

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Backend Sync Endpoint**

Created `/auth/google/sync` endpoint to bridge NextAuth and backend:

```typescript
// Accepts Google user data from NextAuth
// Creates/updates user in database
// Returns JWT tokens for backend authentication
```

#### 2. **NextAuth Integration**

Updated NextAuth callbacks to sync with backend during Google sign-in:

- Added sync call in `signIn` callback
- Preserved onboarding status through JWT token
- Ensured cookies are set for both auth systems

#### 3. **AuthContext Improvements**

- Always checks backend auth (not just when no NextAuth session)
- Prefers backend user data for accurate onboarding status
- Handles both authentication methods seamlessly

#### 4. **API Proxy Configuration**

- Changed from `/api/*` to `/api/backend/*` to avoid conflicts with NextAuth routes
- Updated authApi to use the new base URL
- Ensures proper cookie handling through proxy

### Key Learnings

1. **Don't Fight the Framework**: Initially considered removing NextAuth entirely, but user correctly pointed out we should use Next.js features as intended. Better solution was to integrate properly.

2. **Understand the Root Cause**: The 401 errors weren't from bad data or CORS issues - they were from missing authentication cookies. Understanding this led to the right solution.

3. **Keep It Simple**: The fix was straightforward once properly understood:
   - Google sign-in → Sync with backend → Get JWT cookies → Everything works

4. **Test the Full Flow**: Important to test the complete user journey:
   - Sign in with Google
   - Complete onboarding
   - Sign out and back in
   - Verify they skip onboarding on return

### Self-Evaluation

**What Went Well:**

- ✅ Identified the core issue (two separate auth systems)
- ✅ Created a clean integration that respects both systems
- ✅ Maintained Next.js best practices
- ✅ Fixed the issue comprehensively in one solution

**What Could Be Improved:**

- ❌ Initially overcomplicated with auth checks and delays
- ❌ Considered removing NextAuth instead of integrating
- ❌ Took multiple attempts to understand the cookie domain issue

**Lessons for Future:**

1. When dealing with authentication, map out all the flows first
2. Don't add complexity (delays, retries) before understanding root cause
3. Use framework features as intended - they exist for good reasons
4. Test with real user flows, not just individual endpoints

### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**

- `/backend/src/auth/auth.controller.ts` - Added google/sync endpoint
- `/src/lib/auth.ts` - Updated NextAuth callbacks
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Improved auth checking logic
- `/next.config.js` - Fixed API proxy configuration
- `/src/services/authApi.ts` - Updated base URL

**Time Taken:** ~2 hours (with multiple iterations)

**Complexity Level:** Medium-High (involved understanding multiple auth systems)

### Tomorrow's Focus

- Monitor for any edge cases in the auth flow
- Consider adding better error handling for sync failures
- Document the auth flow for future reference

---

_Note to self: Remember this pattern - when integrating third-party auth with custom backend, always sync user data and ensure both systems have proper credentials._
