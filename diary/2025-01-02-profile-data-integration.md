## Project: Poker Connect Hub - Real User Data Integration

### Challenge Faced

The application was using placeholder data throughout the user interface, particularly in:

- Profile page showing hardcoded user information
- Feed page displaying generic avatars for all posts
- No connection between authenticated user data and UI components
- Username generation from email instead of user's chosen username from onboarding

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Profile Data Hook**

Created `useProfileData` custom hook to centralize user data fetching:

```typescript
// Fetches onboarding data from API
// Combines with auth context data
// Provides fallbacks for missing data
// Returns structured data ready for UI consumption
```

#### 2. **Backend Data Persistence**

Fixed onboarding flow to properly save all user fields:

- Added username, location, and preferredStakes to OnboardingAnswer model
- Updated submit and status endpoints to handle new fields
- Ensured data persists correctly in MongoDB

#### 3. **Username Availability Check**

Implemented real-time username validation during onboarding:

- Created `/api/onboarding/check-username` endpoint
- Added debounced checking with visual feedback
- Validates format (3-20 chars, alphanumeric + underscore/dash)
- Case-insensitive uniqueness check in database

#### 4. **User Avatar Component**

Built reusable `UserAvatar` component with intelligent fallbacks:

```typescript
// Priority: Profile image → Name initials → Generic icon
// Multiple size options (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
// Consistent styling across the app
```

#### 5. **Feed Integration**

Updated feed components to use real user data:

- FeedPostCard displays actual user avatars
- PostComposer shows current user's profile image
- Comments show real user avatars
- SharedHandsStore accepts and stores user data

### Key Learnings

1. **Data Flow Architecture**: Understanding how data flows from auth → onboarding → profile → UI components is crucial for proper integration.

2. **Fallback Strategies**: Always implement graceful fallbacks:
   - Missing image → Show initials
   - Missing name → Show generic icon
   - Missing bio → Show placeholder text

3. **Real-time Validation**: Debouncing API calls for username checking prevents server overload while maintaining good UX.

4. **Component Reusability**: Creating the UserAvatar component once and using it everywhere ensures consistency and reduces code duplication.

### Self-Evaluation

**What Went Well:**

- ✅ Clean implementation of profile data fetching
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Consistent UI/UX across all avatar displays
- ✅ Fixed the root issue of missing data persistence
- ✅ Responsive design maintained throughout

**What Could Be Improved:**

- ❌ Initially missed that username wasn't being saved during onboarding
- ❌ Could have checked data persistence earlier in the process
- ❌ Username validation could include profanity filtering

**Lessons for Future:**

1. Always verify data is being saved before building UI to display it
2. Test the complete user journey from registration to profile display
3. Build reusable components early to avoid duplication
4. Consider all edge cases for user-generated content

### Technical Details

**Files Created:**

- `/src/hooks/useProfileData.ts` - Profile data fetching hook
- `/src/components/ui/user-avatar.tsx` - Reusable avatar component
- `/app/api/onboarding/check-username/route.ts` - Username validation endpoint

**Files Modified:**

- `/app/profile/components/ProfileHeader.tsx` - Display real user data
- `/src/models/user.model.ts` - Added new fields to OnboardingAnswer
- `/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Username validation and data submission
- `/src/components/feed/FeedPostCard.tsx` - Real avatars in feed
- `/src/components/feed/PostComposer.tsx` - Current user avatar
- `/src/stores/sharedHandsStore.ts` - Accept user data for posts
- Various API endpoints for data persistence

**Time Taken:** ~3 hours (including debugging and testing)

**Complexity Level:** Medium (involved multiple systems and data flow)

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Components Created:** 2 (useProfileData hook, UserAvatar component)
- **API Endpoints:** 1 new (check-username)
- **Bug Fixes:** 3 (username persistence, location/stakes display, avatar fallbacks)
- **User Experience Improvements:** 5+ (real avatars, username validation, profile data, etc.)

### Tomorrow's Focus

- Add user profile editing functionality
- Implement user search with avatars
- Consider adding profile image upload
- Add more robust username validation (reserved words, profanity)
- Performance optimization for avatar loading

### User Feedback Integration

The user provided clear, actionable feedback throughout:

1. "Username must be what users put on onboarding" - Led to discovering the persistence bug
2. "Display @username all lowercase" - Simple but important UX detail
3. "If user has no image, display a placeholder" - Prompted the fallback system design

This collaborative approach led to a much better implementation than initially planned.

_Note to self: Always verify data persistence end-to-end before building UI. A beautiful interface displaying wrong data is worse than a simple one showing correct data._
